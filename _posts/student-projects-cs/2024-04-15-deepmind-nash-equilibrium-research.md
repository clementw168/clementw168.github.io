## Project Overview

During my last year at CentraleSup√©lec, I had the opportunity to work with Google DeepMind on a research project from October 2023 to April 2024. The goal was to improve the convergence speed of FoReL (Follow the Regularized Leader) based algorithms with population-based ideas.

## Research Focus

### Problem Statement
- Traditional FoReL algorithms can be slow to converge to Nash equilibria
- Population-based methods show promise for improving convergence in multi-agent settings
- Two-player zero-sum normal form games provide a good testbed for algorithm development

### Our Approach
We designed an algorithm that combines FoReL with population-based ideas to achieve faster convergence to Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games.
