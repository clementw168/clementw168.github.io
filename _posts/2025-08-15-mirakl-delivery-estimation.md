> "Building a delivery date estimation model for Mirakl, from initial research to production deployment with comprehensive monitoring."

## Project Overview

I built a delivery date estimation model for Mirakl that predicts when orders will be delivered to customers. This project involved the complete machine learning lifecycle: from initial research and model development to production deployment and performance monitoring.

## Beta Version Trailer

## Technical Implementation

### Model Development
- Developed time series forecasting models to predict delivery dates
- Validated model performance with the product team through extensive testing
- Implemented robust error handling and edge case management

### Production Deployment
- Deployed the model in production using Mirakl's ML infrastructure
- Created automated pipelines for model retraining and updates
- Implemented A/B testing framework for model validation

### Monitoring and Dashboard
- Built comprehensive dashboards to monitor model performance in real-time
- Implemented alerting systems for model drift and performance degradation
- Created visualization tools for business stakeholders

## Results and Impact

The beta program started in July 2025 with three clients, providing delivery date estimations for **50,000 orders per week**. The general release is planned for late September 2025.

### Key Metrics
- **Scale**: 50k orders per week during beta
- **Clients**: 3 initial beta clients
- **Accuracy**: High precision delivery date predictions
- **Reliability**: Robust production deployment with monitoring

## Technical Stack

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Advanced forecasting algorithms for delivery prediction
- **Apache Spark**: Large-scale data processing for training and inference
- **Databricks**: Collaborative data science platform for model development
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration for automated model pipelines
- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking and model versioning

## Challenges and Solutions

### Data Quality
- Implemented robust data validation and cleaning pipelines
- Handled missing data and outliers in delivery information
- Created data quality monitoring systems

### Model Performance
- Optimized for both accuracy and computational efficiency
- Implemented ensemble methods for improved reliability
- Created fallback mechanisms for edge cases

### Production Scalability
- Designed for high-throughput inference
- Implemented efficient batch processing
- Created monitoring systems for production health

## Future Enhancements

- Expansion to additional clients beyond the initial beta
- Integration with more data sources for improved accuracy
- Real-time model updates based on performance feedback
- Advanced analytics for delivery optimization
