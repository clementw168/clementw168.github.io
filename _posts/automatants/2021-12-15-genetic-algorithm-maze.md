> "This project solves a maze game only knowing the distance to the exit using a genetic algorithm, just for the sake of having fun with evolutionary computing."

## Project Overview

This project solves a maze game only knowing the distance to the exit. When the game begins, the player has to provide a list of moves (right, left, top, right). Then the environment returns the distance to the exit after following the list of moves.

I used a genetic algorithm to solve this game only for the sake of having fun with a genetic algorithm.

## Technical Implementation

### Problem Formulation
- **Input**: List of moves (right, left, up, down)
- **Output**: Distance to exit after following the moves
- **Goal**: Find sequence of moves that minimizes distance to exit
- **Constraint**: No direct information about maze layout or current position
