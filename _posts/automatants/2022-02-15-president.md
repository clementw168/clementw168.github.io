## About Automatants  

[Automatants](https://automatants.cs-campus.fr/) is the AI student association of CentraleSupélec. It promotes machine learning by sharing knowledge, organizing events, competitions, and projects.  

I first joined in my 3rd year out of curiosity, and one year later, from January 2021 to January 2022, I became its President. Leading the association was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my student life. We were around 20 members, organized dozens of events, and had a lot of fun. This blog is not about the technical projects, but about my journey as President and what I learned along the way.

## How I Became President  

In September 2020, I went to Automatants’ first meeting for new members. At that time, I was simply curious about AI. People were welcoming, but I found the association less structured than ViaRézo. At the end of the meeting, the older members asked if someone wanted to help organize the cohesion weekend in January. I volunteered with two others, without knowing what it would lead to.  

Organizing that weekend in the middle of the Covid pandemic was a nightmare. One week before the trip, our booking was cancelled. I spent hours calling every possible gîte within 3 hours of Paris, until I found one that accepted us with a deposit that looked suspicious. We did not have any other plan so I paid the deposit. In the end, it turned out to be a beautiful place with two houses and enough beds for everyone.

That weekend changed everything for me. At first, I was stressed and afraid of being bored among strangers. But once there, I spent my time making sure everyone was having fun. We cooked together, played games, hiked, partied… and I realized how much potential this association had. I thought that with some structure and leadership, this association could be amazing.

So I decided to run for President with two other members. One month later, I was elected unanimously. That was the real beginning.

## Life as President


### Courses and Projects

The essence of Automatants was to share knowledge and promote AI. Each semester, Automatants offered a series of open courses on AI: deep learning, computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, statistics… In total, 18 courses of 2 hours and 5 practical workshops of 4 hours, reaching 20 to 100+ students each. I personally taught a course on Generative adversarial networks (GAN) and helped in most of the practical workshops. You can find the material for the GAN course [here](https://automatants.cs-campus.fr/formation/2021_2_Intro_GAN) or the video (in French) [here](https://youtu.be/MrrlHYSFz3c?si=xCAjDiBXxmUveJYw).

We also organized two competitions (computer vision and reinforcement learning) and launched student projects. Each project was supervised by an experienced member with a small group of 2 to 5 students. Over two semesters, we had 16 projects, with 7 successful ones which is not too bad considering that a lot of students drop the project to join other associations. I supervised two projects: handwritten letters classification and neural style transfer.

### Building the AI Hub of CentraleSupélec

My first big mission was to secure a dedicated room for Automatants at CentraleSupélec. Our predecessor had already started the process but it took so long because of the school bureaucracy and the pandemic. After many meetings and negotiations with the school, we finally got it: the AI Hub of CentraleSupélec.

It became our headquarters. We had the freedom to organize it as we wanted, in exchange for presenting projects to sponsors. We even received an incredible NVIDIA DGX A100 for our projects. We also negociated with the school to get two huge sofas.

During the pandemic, having this place was priceless. It quickly became the center of our events, projects, and meetings,a real home for Automatants.

### Events and Partnerships

The year was full of events and partnerships. Here are some of them:

- **Humaviron (March 2021):** A 12-hour charity rowing competition. Since Automatants was not full of athletes, we teamed up with the aeronautics association. Together, 49 participants rowed 179,453 meters in 12 hours.

- **Soirée de l’IA (May 2021):** Our annual AI conference. We invited three speakers: 
    - Science philosopher Anouk Barberousse,
    - Deep learning engineer Jules Salzinger,
    - Entrepreneur Marion Carré.
    Sadly, the physical event was cancelled 3 weeks before due to Covid, so we went online and still gathered 60+ participants.


- **Bouge la Science (May 2021):** With Espérance en Béton, we introduced AI to middle school students from disadvantaged areas. I explained how an AI can play tic-tac-toe — seeing their curiosity was rewarding.  

- **Journée des Bourses:** Each association pitches a project to receive funding. I presented our idea for a reinforcement learning competition, the Mind Games.

- **Ubisoft Conference:** We invited Guillaume Gaudron, Research Director at Ubisoft, to share how the company links academic AI research with video games.  

- **Podcast with PMDS:** A student association from Politecnico di Milano invited us for a podcast discussion on AI.  

- **Collaboration with Assas Legal Innovation:** We presented the basics of AI to law students interested in legal tech.  

- **Partnership with JCS (Junior Enterprise of CentraleSupélec):** We trained their members in AI so they could manage company projects related to machine learning.  

- **Barspé (start of the academic year):** We co-organized a pop-up restaurant with the marching band Bandajoe. We cooked 200 meals — tortillas for the main dish and tiramisu for dessert. My small flat turned into a cooking factory the night before, with 10 people peeling potatoes until midnight. Stressful but so much fun.  

- **Vive la Recherche:** An event to promote research at CentraleSupélec. We presented some of our student AI projects, including neural style transfer.

## Looking Back  

My year as President of Automatants was intense, stressful, and full of challenges — but above all, incredibly rewarding. I discovered what it means to lead a team, organize events, and bring people together around a shared passion.  

It started with a simple weekend trip, and it became one of the most formative experiences of my life.
