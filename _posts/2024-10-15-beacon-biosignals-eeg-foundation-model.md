## About Beacon Biosignals

This was my Master's thesis internship before graduating. I worked at Beacon Biosignals, an American startup that develops cutting-edge neurotechnology and AI solutions for advanced healthcare applications.

## Project Overview

I worked on training a foundation model for sleep EEG time series using self-supervised learning, adapting methods from computer vision such as contrastive learning and DINO to EEG data.

## Technical Approach

### Self-Supervised Learning for EEG
- Adapted contrastive learning techniques from computer vision to EEG time series
- Implemented DINO (self-distillation with no labels) methodology for EEG data
- Developed novel data augmentation strategies specific to EEG signals

### Foundation Model Architecture
- Designed transformer-based architectures for EEG time series processing
- Implemented multi-scale feature extraction for different EEG frequency bands
- Created robust pre-training objectives for unlabeled EEG data

### Sleep Staging Application
- Applied the foundation model to sleep staging classification
- Achieved significant performance with minimal labeled data
- Validated results against fully supervised baselines

## Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 80.02% on sleep staging classification
- **Label Efficiency**: 95% fewer labels required compared to fully supervised approaches
- **Performance Drop**: Only 2.6% performance drop compared to using fully annotated data

### Key Achievements
- Successfully adapted computer vision self-supervised methods to EEG data
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of foundation models in medical time series
- Showed significant reduction in annotation requirements for medical AI

## Technical Innovation

### Data Augmentation for EEG
- Developed time-domain and frequency-domain augmentation strategies
- Implemented noise injection and signal transformation techniques
- Created realistic EEG signal variations for robust pre-training

### Contrastive Learning Adaptation
- Adapted contrastive learning frameworks for temporal EEG data
- Implemented positive and negative sampling strategies for EEG signals
- Designed loss functions optimized for EEG feature learning

### DINO Implementation
- Adapted DINO self-distillation methodology for EEG time series
- Implemented teacher-student architectures for EEG feature learning
- Created momentum-based updates for stable training

## Impact and Applications

### Medical AI Advancement
- Demonstrated the potential of foundation models in medical time series analysis
- Reduced annotation burden for medical AI applications
- Opened new possibilities for self-supervised learning in healthcare

### Sleep Medicine
- Improved sleep staging accuracy with minimal labeled data
- Potential for automated sleep analysis in clinical settings
- Reduced manual annotation requirements for sleep studies

## Technical Stack
