I am currently a PhD Student at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, supervised by [Thomas Bonald](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/bonald/Home_page.html).

## Research Focus

I am working on **graph representation learning**, with a focus on **self-supervised learning**. This research area is particularly exciting as it combines the power of graph neural networks with the efficiency of self-supervised learning methods, potentially reducing the need for large amounts of labeled data.

## Research Context

Graph representation learning has become increasingly important in recent years, with applications spanning from social networks to molecular biology. However, the challenge of obtaining high-quality labeled data for training remains a significant bottleneck. Self-supervised learning offers a promising solution by learning meaningful representations from the graph structure itself, without requiring external labels.

## Future Directions

This PhD represents an exciting opportunity to contribute to the growing field of graph machine learning while developing practical applications that could benefit from more efficient learning paradigms. I look forward to sharing updates on my research progress and findings as the work develops.
