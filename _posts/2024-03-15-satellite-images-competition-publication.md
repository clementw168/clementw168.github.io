> "Competition project to predict leaf area index from Sentinel satellite images, resulting in a publication at the 2023 Big Data from Space (BiDS) conference."

## Project Overview

The goal of this competition was to predict the leaf area index (LAI) for each pixel of satellite images captured by Sentinel 1 and 2. The competition took place in April 2023 and resulted in a publication at the prestigious Big Data from Space conference.
