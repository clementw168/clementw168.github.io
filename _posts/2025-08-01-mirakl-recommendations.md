> "Building product and sellers recommendations model for Mirakl, working on proof of concept with cross-functional team members."

## Project Overview

I worked on building a product and sellers recommendations model for Mirakl as part of a proof of concept project. This was a collaborative effort with other team members, conducted before the start of my PhD program.

## Technical Approach

### Recommendation System Design
- Developed algorithms to recommend relevant products to customers
- Built seller recommendation systems to help customers find the best vendors
- Implemented collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation approaches

### Data Processing
- Processed large-scale e-commerce data using Apache Spark
- Implemented efficient data pipelines for real-time recommendations
- Optimized data structures for fast recommendation retrieval

### Model Development
- Experimented with various recommendation algorithms
- Implemented matrix factorization techniques
- Developed hybrid approaches combining multiple recommendation strategies

## Technical Stack

- **Recommender Systems**: Advanced recommendation algorithms for e-commerce
- **Apache Spark**: Large-scale data processing for recommendation training
- **Databricks**: Collaborative platform for recommendation system development
- **Machine Learning**: Various ML techniques for personalized recommendations

## Challenges and Solutions

### Scalability
- Designed recommendation systems to handle large product catalogs
- Implemented efficient algorithms for real-time recommendation generation
- Optimized for both accuracy and computational performance

### Data Quality
- Handled sparse data in user-item interaction matrices
- Implemented robust data preprocessing for recommendation training
- Created validation frameworks for recommendation quality

### Business Integration
- Ensured recommendations align with business objectives
- Implemented A/B testing frameworks for recommendation evaluation
- Created metrics to measure recommendation effectiveness

## Impact and Learning

This project provided valuable experience in:
- Building large-scale recommendation systems
- Working with e-commerce data and business requirements
- Collaborating on proof-of-concept projects
- Understanding the challenges of production recommendation systems

## Future Directions

The proof of concept work laid the foundation for potential production implementation, with considerations for:
- Real-time recommendation serving
- Integration with Mirakl's existing platform
- Advanced personalization techniques
- Performance optimization for scale
