> "Short freelance mission analyzing business opportunities with deep insights on algorithm predictions using explainable AI techniques."

## Project Overview

Right before coming back from Germany, I accepted a short one-month mission as a Freelance Data Analyst at Etandex. The project consisted of predicting the potential of a commercial opportunity and providing deep insights on how to explain the predictions of the algorithms.

## Technical Approach

### Predictive Modeling
- **Commercial Opportunity Prediction**: Building models to assess business opportunity potential
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from business data
- **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms for business prediction tasks
- **Performance Validation**: Ensuring model reliability and accuracy

### Explainable AI Implementation
The client wanted deep insights on how to explain the predictions of the algorithms, leading to the implementation of multiple explainability techniques:

#### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

- **Global Explanations**: Understanding overall model behavior
- **Local Explanations**: Explaining individual predictions
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying most influential variables
- **Interaction Effects**: Discovering feature interactions

#### LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- **Local Approximation**: Creating interpretable models for individual predictions
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying relevant features for each prediction
- **Trust Building**: Helping users understand and trust model decisions
- **Model Validation**: Verifying model behavior on specific cases

#### Anchor Explanations
- **Rule-Based Explanations**: Creating human-readable rules for predictions
- **High-Precision Rules**: Ensuring explanations are highly accurate
- **Coverage Analysis**: Understanding rule applicability across different cases
- **Decision Boundaries**: Clarifying when predictions change

## Technical Stack

- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for high-performance prediction
- **SHAP**: Comprehensive model explainability framework
- **LIME**: Local interpretable model explanations
- **Anchor**: Rule-based explanation generation
- **Python**: Data analysis and machine learning implementation

## Business Impact

### Decision Support
- **Opportunity Assessment**: Providing quantitative evaluation of business opportunities
- **Risk Analysis**: Identifying potential risks and challenges
- **Resource Allocation**: Supporting strategic decision-making
