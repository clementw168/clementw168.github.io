> "Implementation of ABBA (Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based symbolic Aggregation) for time series representation and forecasting with LSTM networks."

## Project Overview

This project was part of the [Machine Learning for Time Series course](http://www.laurentoudre.fr/ast.html) of Laurent Oudre. I implemented two papers on time series representation, focusing on the ABBA method for symbolic aggregation of time series data.

## ABBA Method

### Core Concept
ABBA (Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based symbolic Aggregation) is a method for converting time series into symbolic representations that preserve important statistical properties while reducing dimensionality.

### Key Features
- **Adaptive Segmentation**: Automatically determines optimal segmentation points
- **Brownian Bridge**: Uses Brownian bridge processes for statistical modeling
- **Symbolic Representation**: Converts continuous time series into discrete symbols
- **Reconstruction**: Allows reconstruction of original time series from symbols

## Implementation Results

## Technical Implementation

### ABBA Algorithm
- **Segmentation**: Adaptive segmentation based on statistical criteria
- **Symbol Generation**: Creating symbolic representations from segments
- **Compression**: Reducing time series dimensionality while preserving information
- **Reconstruction**: Rebuilding time series from symbolic representation

### LSTM Integration
- **Raw Time Series**: Direct LSTM processing of original time series
- **ABBA Preprocessing**: LSTM processing of ABBA symbolic representation
- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluating forecasting accuracy between approaches

## Results and Analysis

### Performance Metrics
- **Compression Ratio**: Significant reduction in data dimensionality
- **Reconstruction Quality**: High fidelity reconstruction from symbols
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: Comparable or improved forecasting performance
- **Computational Efficiency**: Faster processing with symbolic representation

### Key Findings
- ABBA representation maintains important statistical properties
- LSTM networks can effectively work with symbolic representations
- Significant compression without major performance loss
- Improved interpretability of time series patterns
