> "Implementation and evaluation of mixture density networks for multi-modal regression tasks across several datasets."

## Project Overview

This project was part of the [Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Generative Models course](https://lmbp.uca.fr/~latouche/mva/IntroductiontoProbabilisticGraphicalModelsMVA.html) of Pierre Latouche and Pierre-Alexandre Mattei. The goal was to implement mixture density networks and evaluate their efficiency on several datasets.

## Mixture Density Networks

### Core Concept
Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are neural networks that can model complex, multi-modal probability distributions by combining multiple Gaussian components. Unlike standard neural networks that output single values, MDNs output parameters of a mixture distribution.

### Key Components
- **Neural Network Backbone**: Standard feedforward network for feature extraction
- **Mixture Parameters**: Output layer that predicts mixture weights, means, and variances
- **Probabilistic Output**: Full probability distribution instead of point estimates
- **Multi-Modal Modeling**: Ability to capture multiple possible outcomes

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Design
- **Input Processing**: Standard neural network layers for feature extraction
- **Mixture Head**: Specialized output layer for mixture parameters
- **Parameter Constraints**: Ensuring valid probability distributions
- **Loss Function**: Negative log-likelihood for mixture distributions

### Training Process
- **Likelihood Optimization**: Maximizing probability of observed data
- **Parameter Regularization**: Preventing overfitting in mixture components
- **Convergence Monitoring**: Tracking training stability and performance

## Evaluation and Results

### Dataset Performance
- **Synthetic Data**: Multi-modal regression tasks with known ground truth
