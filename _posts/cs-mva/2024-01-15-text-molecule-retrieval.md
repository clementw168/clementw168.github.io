> "Building a system to retrieve molecules from text queries using contrastive learning between molecular graphs and text descriptions."

## Project Overview

This project was part of the [Advanced learning for text and graph data course](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/cat-advanced-learning-for-text-and-graph-data-altegrad/) of Michalis Vazirgiannis. The goal was to retrieve molecules from a text query, bridging the gap between natural language descriptions and molecular structures.
