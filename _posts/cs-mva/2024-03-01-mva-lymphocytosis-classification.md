## Project Overview

This project aimed to build an automated system to distinguish **reactive** from **tumoral lymphocytosis** using blood smear images along with patient metadata. The dataset, collected at Lyon Sud University Hospital, included 204 patientsâ€”142 for training and 42 for testing. The goal was to support clinicians in identifying cases that require **flow cytometry**, reducing costs and improving diagnostic accuracy.

This work was part of the [Deep Learning for Medical Imaging course](https://www.aramislab.fr/teaching/DLMI-2020-2021/) by Olivier Colliot and Maria Vakalopoulou.


## Approach

We received multiple cell images per patient along with tabular patient information. I experimented with three modeling strategies:

1. **Tabular-only model** using patient metadata.  
2. **CNN-based image model** ignoring tabular data.  
3. **Multi-modal model** combining images and tabular features.

Due to the small dataset, results were very noisy, with metrics fluctuating on both the validation set and the Kaggle leaderboard. I decided to drop the course because I felt like the design of the competition was wrong. My final submission placed **top 6 out of 30 participants**, even though I was around 15th on the public leaderboard before the private evaluation shuffled rankings.

The experience highlighted the limitations of small datasets in deep learning for medical imaging and the importance of robust evaluation.
