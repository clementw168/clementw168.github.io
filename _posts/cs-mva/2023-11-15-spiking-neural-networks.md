> "One-week project exploring Spiking Neural Networks, benchmarking performance on image classification and time series classification tasks."

## Project Overview

This was a short one-week project on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). We aimed to explain the behavior of a spiking neural network and benchmarked the performance of SNNs on image classification and time series classification tasks.

## Spiking Neural Networks

### Core Concept
Spiking Neural Networks are the third generation of neural networks that more closely mimic biological neural networks. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks that use continuous values, SNNs use discrete spikes (action potentials) to communicate information.

### Key Components
- **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Model**: Basic neuron model that accumulates input and fires when threshold is reached
- **Spike Timing**: Information encoded in the timing of spikes rather than continuous values
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Computation only occurs when spikes are present
- **Biological Plausibility**: More closely resembles actual brain function

## Technical Implementation

### LIF Neuron Model
- **Membrane Potential**: Accumulates input over time
- **Leak Current**: Gradual decay of membrane potential
- **Threshold Mechanism**: Firing when potential exceeds threshold
- **Refractory Period**: Brief period after firing when neuron cannot fire again

### Network Architecture
- **Input Encoding**: Converting continuous inputs to spike trains
- **Synaptic Connections**: Weighted connections between neurons
- **Learning Rules**: Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
- **Output Decoding**: Converting spike patterns to classification results

## Benchmarking Results

### Image Classification
- **Dataset**: Standard computer vision benchmarks
- **Performance**: Comparison with traditional neural networks

- **Accuracy**: Classification accuracy on test sets

### Time Series Classification
- **Dataset**: Temporal data classification tasks
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Leveraging spike timing for sequence modeling

## Technical Analysis

### Advantages of SNNs
- **Energy Efficiency**: Event-driven computation reduces energy consumption
