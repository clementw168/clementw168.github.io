> "The project consists in classifying between three labels (neutral / positive / negative) how a sentence is perceived given an aspect of it highlighted by a specific word in the sentence."

## Project Overview

Part of the [Natural Language Processing course](https://sites.google.com/view/dsba-nlp-course/home?authuser=0) of Naver Labs Europe. The project consists in classifying between three labels (neutral / positive / negative) how a sentence is perceived given an aspect of it (whether it is about the food quality, the general ambiance and so on) highlighted by a specific word in the sentence.

## Technical Approach

### Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
- **Aspect Identification**: Identifying specific aspects in text (food quality, ambiance, service, etc.)
- **Aspect-Term Highlighting**: Focusing on specific words that represent aspects
- **Polarity Classification**: Determining sentiment polarity for each aspect
- **Context Understanding**: Understanding how context affects sentiment

### Model Architecture
We fine-tuned DistilBERT for that specific task.
