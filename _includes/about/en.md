Hello! I'm Clement Wang, a PhD Candidate at Institut Polytechnique de Paris and Mirakl. I'm passionate about the intersection of mathematics and computer science, particularly when strong theoretical foundations meet practical applications. Professionally, I consider myself a hybrid between a researcher and an engineer.

In the past, I worked on many different projects, which is why I do not like to describe myself as a specialist of a topic.

##### A few facts about myself

- I was born in France from Asian parents, have lived in the US and Germany for 6 months each.
- Even though I'm not particularly good at it, I love sports: volleyball, bouldering, spikeball, running, biking...
- There's no fun if I don't aim for the best. Being competitive brings so much value, and it's okay not to be the best.
- One day, I was playing basketball to cool down after an exam when I slipped on a clementine and broke my ankle. I then walked with crutches for 2 months.
