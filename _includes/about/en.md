Hey, I am Clement Wang, a PhD Candidate at Institut Polytechnique de Paris and Mirakl. I am passionate about the intersection of mathematics and computer science. I particularly enjoy when strong theoretical foundations meet practical applications. I considered myself as a hybrid between a researcher and an engineer.

In the past, I worked on many different projects, which is why I do not like to describe myself as a specialist of a topic.

##### Research & Publications
