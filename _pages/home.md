AI & Deep learning
======

I have always been passionnate by mathematics and computer science. Three years ago, I found out that I could do both with Artificial Intelligence and from that moment, I have been striving to learn more about AI, especially Deep Learning. I find it so interesting to understand how learning algorithms work.

<!-- I love both spending my time reading philosophy in a silent park and partying with friends. -->
One day, I was playing basketball to cool down after an exam. I slipped on a clementine and broke my ankle. Then I walked with crutches for 2 months.
