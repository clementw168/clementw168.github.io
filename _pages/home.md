Hi, my name is Tanguy Marsaut and welcome to my website. I've developped this
website using the project
[academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) mostly
to get a grasp on the ins and outs of setting up an academic website, but also
to be able to talk a bit about my research, my projects, and the other various
topics I fancy or might fancy in the future. 

Academic interests
======
I'm a physics student in Quantum Technology at CentraleSup√©lec, Paris, France.
I'm passionate of quantum physics in general and that's why I've chosen to
follow down the path of quantum technologies. This year I'll be mostly studying
condensed matter physics with applications on semiconductors, supraconductors
and more involved quantum technologies. I will also be attending classes on more
fundamental topics like cosmology, quantum field theory, particle physics and
topics at the border between mathematics and physics. 

Although I'm following MSc in Quantum Technologies, that is to say applied physics, I'm probably even more
interested in theoretical and mathematical physics. I'm really keen on learning
about our fundamental understanding of the Universe and I decided to teach
myself quantum field theory, general relativity and a bit of string theory using
the various available resources online (I could never thank Pr. David Tong
enough). 

Hobbies
======
Let me be more interesting in this section and talk less about physics and mroe
about having fun (though I could argue for hours on how much fun physics is...).
For most of my life I've been a competitive chess player with a FIDE rating of 1986. 
I really enjoy the team spirit there is when I play with my team in
national competitions but also the competitive spirit and the support we offer
each other with my friends when we play in individual tournaments. I also passed
the chess initiator degree (DIFFE) and hence often taught chess lessons to
peopel with various backgrounds. 

I'm also quite fond of racket sports of every kind, that is to say tennis, table
tennis or even badminton. However, I've only practiced table tennis
competitively and at a very humble level. 

Finally, I love electro music and festival. I'm always listening to DJ sets and
I've actually started myself to DJ a bit. Although I'm still highly
unexperimented, I really enjoy it!

Obviously, I didn't emphasize again on my love for maths and physics in general,
but I'm pretty sure you got it by now!
